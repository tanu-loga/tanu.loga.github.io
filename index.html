    <h1>Cybersecurity & Programming Portfolio</h1>

    <p>Welcome to my site. This site documents my learning journey and showcases my work in cybersecurity and programming. Here, you’ll find detailed writeups of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, hands-on lab exercises, and tutorials on key security concepts and tools.</p>

    <p>Each project includes explanations and tutorials aimed at helping others understand key concepts, learn practical techniques, and follow the problem-solving process step by step—with some humour—while also showcasing my own skills and approach.</p>

    <p>My goal with this portfolio is to track my growth, share knowledge, and present a professional record of my skills—both for academic applications and future career opportunities. All content is created with an emphasis on ethical and responsible practice, keeping learning and safety at the forefront.</p>
